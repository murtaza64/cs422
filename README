List here the following info:
1. Murtaza Javaid, Daniel Li
2. Coded together
3. In first part, implemented code to perform a thread context switch as well as a thread queue for inserting and removing threads.
In the second part, implemented a trap handler which has a handler for each exception and interrupt by using an IDT. Also inplemented 
Syscalls by retrieving arguments from user context and return an error number using the eax. 
In the third part, we carried a copy-on-write fork system call that spawns a child thread from a parent thread. We allocate a new pagetable
for the child and copy over the mappings from the parent, but allocate new pages when the copy on write occurs.
